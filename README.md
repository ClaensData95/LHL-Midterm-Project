# Data Science Midterm Project

## Project/Goals
loading, preprocessing, and exploring data
1. Load the data from the provided JSON files into a Pandas DataFrame
2. Explore, clean and preprocess your data to make it ready for Machine Learning Modelling
3. Exploratory Data Analysis - to help understand the distributions and relationships between variables/parameters
## Process
### (your step 1)
- EDA
### (your step 2)
- Model Selection
### (your step 2)
- Tuning and Pipelining  
## Results
(fill in how your model performed)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
